      I am attending a coding bootcamp course at Lifechoices Academy. I
      specialise in both User Interface/User Experience. I bring design and
      functionality and transform Applications. My skills range from a wide variety of coding niches, from databases to
      graphic design and UI/UX management, and I do my job pretty well.
