            I think Reese is a very creative student. I think she enjoys working
            with her classmates. She has learned many new words through the
            class readings and our lessons. I am quite happy with the effort she
            puts into her work. Its a pleasure to see her projects which she
            worked on so far. I recommend her.

            Through focus, hard work and dedication, Reese has quickly gained
            and improved her skills as a software developer. Reese has a
            'never-give-up' attitude, and a work ethic that will make her a
            great asset to any team. She has proven to be both diligent and
            consistent in her studies. I would recommend Reese to anyone looking
            for a great team player and motivated developer.
